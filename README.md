# Blueshift Engine
Blueshift is a high performance game engine written for the modern game industry. It must be held to high standards, as it will serve as the engine for Titan Interactive's flagship game, NoxAstra.

## Dependencies
Blueshift seeks to minimize dependencies in order to maximize portability and keep the codebase size down. Right now, we're using the following dependencies:
